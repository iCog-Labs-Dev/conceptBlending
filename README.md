# Conceptual Blending Module

This project implements a set of AI-driven conceptual blending systems that integrate **symbolic reasoning (MeTTa)** and **optimization techniques** to generate creative conceptual combinations. The system supports **GPT-enhanced conceptualization**, **constraint-based scoring**, and **information-theoretic evaluation** of conceptual blends.

## ðŸ“‚ Submodules

### ðŸ”¹ [Info-Theoretic Approach with CMA-ES and GA](./an_infotheoretic_approach/README.md)
This is the **main executable pipeline** that combines:
- Symbolic concept representation in **MeTTa**
- **Information-theoretic analysis** (entropy, emergence, mutual information)
- **Optimization using CMA-ES and Genetic Algorithms**
- Integration with **GPT** and **ConceptNet** agents
- Evaluation through **Optimality Constraints** (e.g., topology, unpacking, good reason)


### ðŸ”¹ [Naive Blending Approach (Graph-Matching-Based)](./a_naive_approach/README.md)
A simpler conceptual blending prototype based on **graph matching and GPT**.



##  What is Conceptual Blending

Conceptual blending is a cognitive process of **combining elements from multiple conceptual spaces** to form novel and meaningful ideas. This project automates blending using:

- **Symbolic AI (MeTTa)** to represent and manipulate concepts.
- **Information-theoretic methods** to quantify blend quality.
- **LLMs (like GPT)** to extract and augment conceptual features.
- **Optimization strategies** to search for high-fitness blends.
