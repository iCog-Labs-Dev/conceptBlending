# An info theoretic implementation of conceptual blending.

## Overview
The **Information-Theoretic Conceptual** Blending system enhances concept synthesis by integrating symbolic reasoning in MeTTa with a set of **information-theoretic algorithms** that quantitatively analyze and blend conceptual representations. it leverages **semantic entropy**, **probabilistic property scoring**, and **emergent structure analysis** to generate grounded and novel concept blends.

- Analyzes the distribution of properties for given concepts.
- Computes emergence, maximum and minimum values, and degree of concept structure.
- Produces high-quality blends only if the mutual emergence metric surpasses a defined threshold.
- Integrates with GPT to refine representations and select a suitable blending network.

## Setup and Run

### Prerequisities

- **For Windows Users**: The hyperon package version (0.2.4) required by this project doesn't have pre-compiled binaries for Windows. Therefore,you must use the Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL) 2 to run this project.
- **Python Version**: This project requires Python 3.8 or newer (compatible up to Python 3.13).
### 1. Clone the repository and navigate to the folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iCog-Labs-Dev/conceptBlending.git
cd conceptBlending/an_infotheoretic_approach
```
### 2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file and add one of the following API credentials:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the Project

#### info-theoretic.metta
Calculates entropy, emergence, and mutual information metrics to evaluate blends.

#### space-info-theoretic.metta

Defines the concept blend space using symbolic MeTTa atoms and relations.

#### GA-imp.metta
implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search through the conceptual blend space and evolve high-quality blends over generations

#### cma-es-imp.metta
implements the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), a more advanced, continuous optimization method designed for real-valued representations of blends.



### Testing
To run all test files for MeTTa implementations

```bash
python scripts/run-tests.py
```
This will run all MeTTa-based test suites under tests/, including:

- info-theoretic-tests.metta
- GA-impl-tests.metta
- cma-es-tests.metta
- and utility modules like list-op-utils-tests.metta
