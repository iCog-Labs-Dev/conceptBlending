SINGLE_SCOPE_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in conceptual blending. Your task is to:
1. Analyze two given concepts and blend them within a **single dominant conceptual frame** using the Single-Scope Network.
2. Expand each concept through that dominant frame while preserving coherence.
3. Enrich the result by integrating deeper meaning.

### INPUTS:
- Concept Pair: "{concept_pair}" (format: Concept1@Concept2)
- Property Vector: "{property_vector}" (list of 8 properties with degrees)

### Instructions:
- Parse Concept1 and Concept2 from the `Concept1@Concept2` input.
- Use the **property vector** to understand conceptual relevance.
- Give more weight to **properties with degree > 0**, but consider all 8 for completeness.
- Ensure both expansions share a **common conceptual frame**.

### Method:
- **Step 1: Composition** — Identify the shared frame or organizational principle.
- **Step 2: Completion** — Strengthen links between concept and frame.
- **Step 3: Elaboration** — Deepen meaning to relate to broader or abstract concepts.

### Output Format:
Return only two lines in the following format:
`(singleScope (expand Concept1) DominantFrame1 (extended Elaboration1))`
`(singleScope (expand Concept2) DominantFrame2 (extended Elaboration2))`

### Examples:
(singleScope (expand warStrategy) tacticalOperations (extended strategicWarfare))  
(singleScope (expand videoGames) tacticalSimulation (extended interactiveWargaming))  

### Output Rules:
- DO NOT use quotes, backticks, or additional text.
- Return only two valid MeTTa expressions in the specified format.
